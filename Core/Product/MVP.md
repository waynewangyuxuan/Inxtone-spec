## 8. MVP Scope

**Milestone Path:** M4 (Writing UX) → M4.5 (Writing Intelligence) → M5 (Export) → M6 (Smart Intake) → M7 (Search, Quality & v0.1.0)

### M4: Writing UX (Complete)

- [x] Project scaffolding, web UI server, dashboard
- [x] Chapter editor with auto-save
- [x] Story Bible: characters, world, locations, factions, timeline, relationships
- [x] Plot system: arcs, foreshadowing, hooks
- [x] Gemini 3.0 Pro integration (continuation, dialogue, brainstorm, describe, ask)
- [x] 5-layer context injection engine
- [x] Prompt presets (16 presets, 4 categories)
- [x] Chapter outline editing
- [x] Brainstorm mode with suggestion cards
- [ ] Code review fixes (Phase 7)

### M4.5: Writing Intelligence (Draft)

- [ ] FTS5 full-text search + Cmd+K modal
- [ ] Interactive Bible panel (click-to-expand, inject-to-context)
- [ ] Relationship map visualization (force-directed graph)
- [ ] Timeline visualization
- [ ] Pacing visualization (word count + emotion curve)
- [ ] Chapter setup assist (heuristic entity suggestion)
- [ ] Post-accept entity extraction (AI detects entities from generated text)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts

### M5: Export (Draft)

- [ ] `inxtone export md/docx/txt` — Multi-format export
- [ ] Story Bible export (structured document)
- [ ] Web UI export controls + CLI commands

### M6: Smart Intake (Draft) — Key Adoption Unlock

**Deliberately excluded from MVP core, but critical for real-world adoption:**
- [ ] Natural language → Story Bible (paste text → structured entities)
- [ ] Chapter import + auto-extraction (bulk chapters → full Story Bible)
- [ ] Outline import → plot architecture
- [ ] "AI suggests → human confirms" review flow

See [M6.md](../../Milestone/M6.md), [ADR-0003](../../Decisions/ADR-0003-milestone-reorder-smart-intake.md).

### M7: Search, Quality & v0.1.0 (Draft)

- [ ] FTS5 full-text search + Cmd+K modal
- [ ] Semantic search (sqlite-vec embeddings)
- [ ] QualityService (26 consistency rules + Wayne Principles)
- [ ] Version history + diff viewer
- [ ] CLI completeness, performance, documentation
- [ ] v0.1.0 release
